# TASK_6-Decision-tree-classifier
I've made this project as a part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation under Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) .My task was to create the Decision Tree classiﬁer and visualize it graphically on Iris dataset. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classiﬁer, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
